# Is the Performance of Artificial Neural Networks Superior to Classical ML Models in Recognizing Handwritten Digits? 
## A Comparative Study Using the MNIST Dataset

---

### Abstract:
This project explores the performance differences between classical machine learning (ML) models and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for recognizing handwritten digits, using the MNIST dataset. We evaluate three classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and compare their performance metrics against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a popular deep learning architecture for image recognition tasks. The comparison will be based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency. By analyzing these models' capabilities, we aim to identify whether ANNs significantly outperform classical ML models for this specific task and how their performance metrics differ in handling real-world datasets like MNIST.
